Font and text wrap
You’ll find the main font in 00008171 located in KSC-MAIN. It’s a simple FLA file underneath.
The game also has a hardcoded text wrap located in the form a few <br>s in the KSC-Scripts archive.
Just do a search within the extracted directory to find the right file. You can replace the <br> 
with a non-existent tag like <aa> to get rid of the forced line break.

If you have plans to translate from the English Version, 
You need use the "Recovery" Function to restore the script
encryption, or edit the source to don't compress and don't
encrypt the translated script.
